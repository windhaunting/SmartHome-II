# SmartHome-II

:The Gateway is made fault tolerant by adding an replication of data base that can take care of all the

devices and sensors when failures occur. Gateway and its replication can also share load between them

by sharing the sensors and devices which they can co- ordinate. A Cache is present between database

and gateway to improve performance.
